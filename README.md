# personaltrainer

Project for the Front-end course at Haaga-Helia UAS.

This is a simple front-end web app that I worked on with the guidance of <a href='https://github.com/juhahinkula'>Juha Hinkula</a>.

Using his back-end, the main funcionalities of this web app are to list the clients, list the trainings, and implement CRUD functionalities for both clients and trainings.

The project uses React to fetch, post, edit, and delete data from the back-end.

The layout is done with Material UI and React Table.
